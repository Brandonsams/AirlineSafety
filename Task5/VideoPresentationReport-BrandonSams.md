# Presentation Design Decisions

I structured the presentation so that it would have a beginning, middle, and an end. I also wanted each section to be laid out for the audience. I even had a slide dedicated to the "road map" for the presentation itself. I like when presenters do this, because it makes it easier to follow along with what they are saying, and where they are going.

As far as visual design for the presentation, I decided on a teal, black, and white color scheme. I thought this was a good choice for three reasons.
1. It is a high-contrast color combination
2. Not a morbid color scheme (we are talking about deaths and crashes, after all)
3. It is not linked to any airline that I could find. I didn't want to seem like I was speaking from the point of view of an airline, just a data scientist.

I would also like to touch on the "Common Statements about airline safety" slide I presented. This, I believe, is critical. If an audience member mentally checks out of the presentation because they think airline safety is boring or they have heard it before, the I want to let the audience know that this is not just another one of those presentations. There is genuinely new information here that the audience may not have heard before. 

Finally, I believe it is critical to establish that yes, flying can be a terrifying activity. This acknowledges and creates a sense of understanding with the audience, in hopes of ensuring that they will listen to the remainder of the presentation. I put this at the front of the presentation, because I felt it was critical to do this before more of the audience mentally checked out.

# Data Preparation

The data source originally was broken down by airline, but I felt that this data would not be helpful for an audience member. After all, I was trying to argue that "flying in general is safe", not that "airline X is the safest". So I added up all the accidents that took place, and looked at the data in terms of the airline industry worldwide.

# Audience Distinction

The difference between presenting to a general audience and presenting to an internal audience is that I, as the presenter, am not allowed to assume anything about the knowledge base of the audience. If I am talking about a concept, then I need to start from first principles. Whereas with an internal audience (such as the one I was speaking to with the executive summary), I can assume at least some domain knowledge is present in my audience. 

# Starting Over - Decision Making

If I were to start over, I would have done more work to handle outliers in the original dataset. If I remember correctly, there were a few airlines I had never heard of that were culpable for the lion's share of the crash data.

I also wish I had been able to make a geographic visualization. I expect that some of the crash data comes from particularly dangerous routes or regions, so it would have been a good idea to visualize that concept in some way.
